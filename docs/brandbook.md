# Logo

## Positioning

* Top left corner in written documents and on the [website](https://www.dxw.com/)

* On the left in the footer on dxw products and related sites, for example on [new GovPress](https://hosting.staging.dxw.net/) or [new dxw security](https://security.staging.dxw.net/)

## Colour variations

* Dark and light blue logo is the original versions, used on dxw website, in banners and other documents.

* White logo version is used on dxw products sites, in the footer, on black (#283133) background. We also use white version a solid colour background in slidedecks.

* Black logo version is not used anywhere online. However, we have it available in the [dxw branding folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-QLubnLOpX0TUdfN1B1dXlLem8) and use it for stamps or mugs.

* Stacked version is not used online either, available for print design purposes.

## Versions

* Full logo version is used on dxw website and product sites (in header and footer). It’s also on the first page of a document.

* The d marque can be found in the footer of written documents, slidedecks and next to the header navigation on scroll.

# Typography

## dxw typeface

[Founders Grote](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Z3pFTJZM5OME92c2xMWEdMdFk)[sk Text](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Z3pFTJZM5OME92c2xMWEdMdFk)

Use **Light** for body text and **Medium** for headings.

## Google Docs font

An alternative font used in shared Google documents is Montserrat. It’s the closest match to Founders Grotesk.

## Tips for good typography

### Line length

Keep lines between 55–70 characters in length for readability. Don’t make text fill up the space just because it’s available. 

### Alignment

Left-align in most cases. Don’t centre-align large chunks of text. Avoid justified text.

### Size and weight

Try and keep variations on a page to a minimum. Start with one or two sizes and one or two weights.

### Density of information

Keep it light as far as possible. Better to have multiple pages with one clear message on each, than one page with an overload of information.

# Photography guidelines

## Headshots

Team headshots are taken against the white wall in the meeting room. 

## Office photography

Office photography used on our digital and printed should look natural. It should reflect the dxw culture and agile workflow.

Photography details include:

* dxw team at work, at their desks, in the meeting room, coding, talking to each other, card-sorting, planning, discussing etc.

* dxw office, white boards, wireframes, post-its and index cards, books, desks, office details like things on the bookshelf etc.

Where practical, size images using the [golden ratio (1:1.618).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)

Keep in mind the [rule of thirds for image composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds).
