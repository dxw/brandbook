## Positioning

* Top left corner on [websites](https://www.dxw.com/)

* On the left in the footer on dxw products and related sites, for example on [new GovPress](https://hosting.staging.dxw.net/) or [new dxw security](https://security.staging.dxw.net/)

## Colour variations

* Dark and light blue logos are the main versions — unless you're against a solid coloured background, always use these.

* White logo version is used on dxw products sites, in the footer, on black (`#283133`) background. White versions are also available for use against most solid coloured backgrounds e.g. slide decks, apart from yellow (`#ffb72c`) — against this, use a black logo.

* Black logo version is not used anywhere online. It's used against solid yellow (`#ffb72c`) backgrounds. However, we have it available in the [dxw branding folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-QLubnLOpX0TUdfN1B1dXlLem8) and use it for stamps or mugs.

## Versions

* Full logo versions are used on the dxw website and product sites (in header and footer). It’s also on the first page of a document.

* The [d marque](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xfo7N4OEXtQkqPBjgD7_VVUIE7cbyshw) can be found in the footer of written documents, slidedecks and next to the header navigation on scroll. Use the d marque on multi-page documents, where excessively repeating the full logo feels like overkill. In this situation, make sure the full version is on the front page.

# Typography

## dxw typeface

[Founders Grote](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Z3pFTJZM5OME92c2xMWEdMdFk)[sk Text](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Z3pFTJZM5OME92c2xMWEdMdFk)

Use **Light** for body text and **Medium** for headings.

## Google Docs font

An alternative font used in shared Google documents is [Work Sans.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) It’s the closest match to Founders Grotesk.

## Tips for good typography

### Line length

Keep lines between 55–70 characters in length for readability. Don’t make text fill up the space just because it’s available. 

### Alignment

Left-align in most cases. Don’t centre-align large chunks of text. Avoid justified text.

### Size and weight

Try and keep variations on a page to a minimum. Start with one or two sizes and one or two weights.

### Density of information

Keep it light as far as possible. Better to have multiple pages with one clear message on each, than one page with an overload of information.

# Photography guidelines

## Headshots

Team headshots are taken against the white wall in the meeting room. 

## Office photography

Office photography used on our digital and printed should look natural. It should reflect the dxw culture and agile workflow.

Photography details include:

* dxw team at work, at their desks, in the meeting room, coding, talking to each other, card-sorting, planning, discussing etc.

* dxw office, white boards, wireframes, post-its and index cards, books, desks, office details like things on the bookshelf etc.

Where practical, size images using the [golden ratio (1:1.618).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)

Keep in mind the [rule of thirds for image composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds).
